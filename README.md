A Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree Project


## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Black Friday Dataset from Kaggle to better understand:

Question 1: Which User spent most during black Friday, list the top 20 spending users

Question 2: How about the User Distribution by Age Group? And also consider Gender

Question 3: Which products are most popular during Black Friday, list the top 20

Question 4: Look at the users again, this time focus on group by Occupation in different city

Question 5: Correlation between Gender, Age, Occupation, City_Category, Stay_In_Current_City_Years, Marital_Status, Product_Category_x vs Purchase

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

BlackFriday.csv       - This file contains 550,000 observations about the black Friday in a retail store, it contains different kinds of variables either numerical or categorical. It contains missing values.

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@bzomarah/data-exploration-on-black-friday-dataset-b29944d7c9d1).
